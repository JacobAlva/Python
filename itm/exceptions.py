''' Occurs when the parser detects a syntactically incorrect statement.'''
# a = 5 print(a))       # there are two syntax errors here

''' A syntactically correct statement might still raise an exception error. There are
    different types defined in this class e.g. TypeError, NameError, IndexError, IOError, etc.
'''

# a = 5 + "5"     # TypeError: unsupported operand

# import somemodule   # ModuleNotFoundError - subclass from the ImportError
